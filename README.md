This app uses verified Pebble Tracker data to mint NFTs for users that will store an image and the pebble tracker metadata, as well as a calculated score for these users. Then each user can opt to join the DAO and the DAO smart contract will utilize the metadata from the NFT to charge each user according to risk (similar in concept to insurance) and at the end of a specified block, the DAO will pay distribute rewards (after costs for covering drivers) that quarter in an airdrop
